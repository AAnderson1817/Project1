# Snowden Simulator: Type or Die

## Objective: You are a prospective whistleblower working for the NSA, and a huge fan of Edward Snowden. He's the tops. Now that he's been exiled, his work unfinished, you have taken it upon yourself to reveal to the American people, nay, THE WORLD, that there is much more going on under the hood at their local intelligence agency. Using guile, cunning, and quick fingers, you are tasked with leaking as much information to The Guardian as possible without getting caught by your superiors. Remember, be accurate! It's bad enough you might be charged for treason--let's not add libel to your laundry list of potential legal troubles.

### Application Needs

1. Build a game that, ultimately, improves the speed and accuracy of the user's keyboard inputs.
2. Log the speed and accuracy of characters inputted, recorded and displayed as WPM or CPS.
3. The game must include the ability for a second player to participate as either the supervisor/screenwatcher, or as a second whistleblower.

### Wants
* A consistent theme applied across all elements related to the intelligence industry and the growing role of Big Data in our everyday lives.
* An interactive image/element similar to the features on the corners of Hearthstone boards. Ideally, it is distracting enough that the user is tempted to occasionally mess with the object, hindering their progress.
* Multiple difficulties.
* The ability to reverse the characters, or randomize the order of words to simulate basic encryption and improve the user's ability to independently process words/characters without auto-completing portions in their head.
* An alternative mode that replaces text with either Text-to-Speech, or pre-recorded audio to be dictated by the user.
* The game be enjoyable as a practical exercise, and improvement should be able to be logged and compared to other users, either locally or online. Humor is encouraged.
* Include "Stop!" "Go!" elements when the supervisor approaches or a screenwatcher is detected by your computer, and when it is safe to resume leaking.
* Include passwords in a "Cheat Sheet" that must be periodically referenced to proceed further into the "file system".

### User Profiles/Story
* Carl Everyman- The generic user with no particular wants or needs. He's here because he either stumbled upon the app, or was recommended by a friend/associate. He doesn't care, but he might be interested if the game gets to the point, uses modern display elements, and he can visibly measure progress and improvement while not boring him to death in process.

* Bob Boss- Bob is a business owner who wants a tool to improve the speed and accuracy of his employees, who might otherwise not be technically minded. He wants something basic that gets to the point and performs the advertised function.

* Minnie Buttonpusher- Minnie is 6 years old, and doesn't know jack shit about programming, typography, or even what the terminal is. She's here because Mom or Dad is playing the game and there isn't a babysitter. She wants something shallow and flashy to keep her feeble mind occupied while she develops a social conscience. "Ooo! A robot!"

* Tom the Tinkerer- Tom is genuinely interested in improving his typing skills, and cares less about the flashy interface as long as the game provides a hardcore challenge that will push his skills to the limit. He doesn't have a tolerance for bugs or laggy interface elements. Tom has a bit of an ego, too, and he wouldn't mind if there was some way he could brag about his relative superiority without directly posting something on Facebook.

* Paula Politic- Paula loves politics, and the mere mention of Edward Snowden lured her in. Paula doesn't necessarily want to improve her typography, but isn't opposed to it either. She's mainly here because the references within are relevant to her interests, and occasionally provide her with a chuckle or two. It's a light distraction she can use on the bus, train, or plane that's a bit more useful than Snood (who plays Snood anymore?) while not so challenging to be a mental drain.

### To Do

* A small information prompt briefly describing the objectives of the game.
* A field that displays the "leak" as text dressed up as top secret documents.
* An input field where User can enter text and return it.
* A button or input that triggers the next document to display. (Hitting enter?)
* A button or other input that User2 can utilize to activate The Supervisor. Very much red light/green light. There is a limit on how many times this intervention can be used, as to standardize the potential difficulty across multiple parties who might be press-happy. Perhaps this intervention occurs at random intervals determined by the computer.
* A function that measures the speed in WPM or CPS. This is displayed on screen either persistently in real time, or at the end at the "High Score" screen.
* A function that measures the accuracy of the text
